Welcome to MammoCare
MammoCare is a powerful tool designed to help doctors and radiologists improve breast cancer detection. 
It works by making mammogram images clearer and more detailed, allowing for better understanding of the breast tissue.

What Makes MammoCare Special?
Better Image Quality:
MammoCare uses advanced techniques to improve the sharpness and clarity of mammogram images, making it easier 
to detect even the smallest abnormalities.

Smart Muscle Removal:
The software includes two ways to remove the pectoral muscle from mammogram images:

A manual method where you can draw and adjust the removal area.
An automatic method powered by smart algorithms, making the process faster and more precise.
Finding Key Regions:
The software highlights the densest areas in the breast tissue. 
These areas are often where abnormalities are found, helping doctors focus on what matters most.

AI Assistance:
MammoCare is connected to an AI system (from aiXplain) that provides insights and answers related to breast cancer. 
Itâ€™s like having an extra expert in the room to support doctors in making decisions.

How It Works
For Manual Adjustments: You can upload a mammogram image, adjust the settings, and remove the pectoral muscle manually to get a cleaner view of the breast tissue.
For Automatic Processing: The software uses advanced algorithms to automatically remove the muscle and highlight suspicious areas.
MammoCare is designed to save time and provide high-quality results, ultimately helping improve breast cancer diagnosis and treatment.
