# MammoCare

MammoCare is a powerful tool designed to assist doctors and radiologists in improving breast cancer detection. It enhances mammogram images, making them clearer and more detailed, which allows for a better understanding of breast tissue. MammoCare helps identify abnormalities by improving the image quality and assisting with muscle removal, all while supporting AI-based insights for decision-making.

## What Makes MammoCare Special?

### 1. **Better Image Quality**
MammoCare uses advanced techniques to enhance the sharpness and clarity of mammogram images. This helps to detect even the smallest abnormalities, improving diagnostic accuracy.

### 2. **Smart Muscle Removal**
MammoCare offers two methods for removing the pectoral muscle from mammogram images:
- **Manual Method**: Allows doctors to draw and adjust the removal area for precision.
- **Automatic Method**: Powered by smart algorithms, this method removes the muscle more quickly and precisely, saving time.

### 3. **Finding Key Regions**
The software highlights the densest areas in the breast tissue, where abnormalities are often found. This helps doctors focus on the most important parts of the mammogram.

### 4. **AI Assistance**
MammoCare integrates with an AI system (from **aiXplain**) that provides valuable insights and answers related to breast cancer. Itâ€™s like having an extra expert in the room to support doctors in making better decisions.

## How It Works

### For Manual Adjustments:
1. Upload a mammogram image.
2. Adjust the settings and manually remove the pectoral muscle to reveal a clearer view of the breast tissue.

### For Automatic Processing:
1. Upload the mammogram image.
2. MammoCare will automatically remove the muscle and highlight key suspicious areas in the breast tissue.
